"""
A double underscore prefix causes the Python interpreter to rewrite the attribute name
in order to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.

This is also called NAME MANGLING â€” the interpreter changes the name of the variable
in a way that makes it harder to create collisions when the class is extended later.
